# My React Portfolio

<p> This is my first react portfolio which gives a little information about me, my skills, my experiences, and my education. The purpose of this portfolio is not only to discuss the above mentioned, although very important, it is also to demonstrate my ability to use react to build a simple app.
<p/>

<p>I used react props and state. I was able to install all the react components and also integrated bootstrap and react-adinkra, a Ghanaian symbols library. This is a great project for me </p>
